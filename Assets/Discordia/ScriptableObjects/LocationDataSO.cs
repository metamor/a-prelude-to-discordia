// should the game use a location SO?

// if we make a location data, we have have procedurally generated servers since the location data with the spawn table can be swapped out instead of living in a scene?

// at the start of the location loading, the enemy spawner will run through the enemy spawn list and spawn until 100 enemy is spawned?

public class LocationDataSO : ScriptableObject
{
    // location name?
    // music for this location; if the music is the same, don't change the music; a dark location might have spooky music as opposed to a sunny location

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
